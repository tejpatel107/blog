Hello Everybody!

This is a project on a blog as a part of the challenge that I have created while taking an online web development course.
This project helped me a lot in understanding how to work with EJS templates, connecting our app.js server file with local MongoDB, server creating, setting up correct routes for GET/POST requests; setting up dynamic routes by using route parameters.

You can publish a post by going to route /compose. Your post will appear on home page after you publish.

Instructions:
1)	Run node app.js in one terminal window,
2)	In another terminal window run command mongo to spin up your local MongoDB server.
3)	In browser visit localhost:3000, it will take you home page of the blog
4)	Check out other links such as About and Contact.
5)	And finally visit /compose route to publish your post.

The content on the blog is random text of Loren Ipsum, this project was for practice purpose only so you wouldnâ€™t find any content relating me.
